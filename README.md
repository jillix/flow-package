### Adding a new module

 1. Add the module git url (if it's hosted on GitHub, you can use the `owner/repo` format) in the [`build/packages.json`](/build/packages.json).
 2. Run `npm i` to install the dev dependencies (if you don't have Node.js installed on your machine, just skip this step and the next one).
 3. Rebuild the packages list by running `npm run refresh`
 4. Commit the things and create a pull request (check the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details).
